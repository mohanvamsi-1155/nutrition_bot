# ðŸ“„ Unstructured PDF Element Categories

This document lists and defines the various `Element` categories returned by the [`unstructured`](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) Python library when parsing documents like PDFs using `partition_pdf`.

The `category` field (formerly `type`) provides semantic context for each extracted chunk, making it easier to structure content for downstream use such as LLMs, vector databases, or information extraction.
